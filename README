Toxicbuild is disributed a tool to continuous integration, heavly inspired
on buidbot, but with its own nicities.

Using toxicbuild you can still configure all your builders and steps using the
full expressiveness of Python, but these configuratoins stay on your project's
source code, so you can versionate it within your project.

Please, see more at the documentation on the docs/ directory.
